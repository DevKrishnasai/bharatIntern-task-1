Hero Section: The hero section introduces the portfolio owner. It includes an image, representing the portfolio owner, and a heading that displays the owner's name. Additionally, a brief description below the heading mentions the owner's professional roles as a web developer and Android developer.

About Section: The about section provides detailed information about the portfolio owner. It includes a heading "About Me" and a paragraph describing the owner's educational background, technical skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React), and other relevant experiences. The paragraph also emphasizes the owner's enthusiasm for web development and dedication to staying updated with new technologies.

Projects Section: The projects section showcases three projects. Each project is represented by a container that includes a heading specifying the project name and a paragraph describing the project's purpose, functionality, and benefits. The projects mentioned in the code are "Todo List Application," "Simple Calculator," and "Tribute to Thomas Alva Edison (Tribute Page)." Additionally, there is an "Upcoming" section marked with a bold label and a dot symbol.

Contact Section: The contact section includes a heading "Contact" and a paragraph inviting users to get in touch. It provides the owner's email address and a LinkedIn profile link for contacting or connecting with the owner.
